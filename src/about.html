  <!-- The Alpenglow Story -->
  <section class="about-story">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Alpenglow Story</h2>
      <p>
        Alpenglow Plumbing & Mechanical was founded on the principle that plumbing and mechanical work should be done right, done cleanly, and done with integrity. After decades of working in the trade, we saw too many homeowners getting poor service from big shops focused on volume over quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started Alpenglow to be different. To take the time to understand each home's unique needs. To explain problems clearly and solutions honestly. To build relationships with our customers, not just complete transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "Alpenglow" reflects what we value—that beautiful moment when mountain peaks catch the first or last light of day. It's a reminder that quality work, done well, is its own reward. We're here to serve Summit County for the long haul, building a reputation one job at a time.
